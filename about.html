                        The main colour palette is green. The imagery used is associated with the aesthetic of plants. Besides looking pretty, these design choices symbolize growth. Just like a plant, our minds need to discuss and analyse things to grow. In this case, I’m speaking about decoloniality and empathy around it. Ever since I started university, I have learnt a lot about colonialism and I have grieved a lot over the effects of it.The topic for this semester is on decolonising technology, and my research project is heavily involved in the themes of decolonisation. It is a topic that I have so much I want to speak on, but so little time to research and cover everything I want to say. My first blog post speaks so much yet covers so little of what I have to say. But I believe that this is a great opportunity to express my hot takes and discuss aspects around decolonisation that I have always taken an interest in.

                        Throughout this website, the theme is consistent. The point is that the information being discussed is meant to educate and expand someone’s mind on the western ideal we live in and why decolonising our systems is needed. This way, I view my website as an artwork itself, as it is symbolic to the goal of educating on the vast concepts around decolonisation.

                        This year, I feel as if I have improved quite a bit from last year’s technical aspect of this project.Although I am still very confused and very incompetent about things involving JavaScript, I do think I have improved in making the website more responsive and thematic to the theory. 
I have made plans around an Internet Art experiment I would like to do. My idea is to create cards (like the blog post cards) that have very specific political and social opinions on them. An example would be a card reading “Elon Musk deserves to be a billionaire”. The point will be for the user to click on the cards they agree with. Once they click on a card with a statement they agree with, they will be redirected and be shown a meme. I think this will be a great way of sticking to the topic of decolonisation, as well as involving the concept of memes. This will also allow me to expand on my discussion of transmediality and internet art.

                     <h1>Why "Bitching" ?</h1>
                     <p><p>                        So now, time to address the vulgar nature of this websites name. Well, the internet defines the word “Bitching” as a verb used when one is complaining about something in an unpleasant way. In my personal life, I have always been criticised and shut down when I try and have educated discussions around misogyny, racism, colonialism etc. I understand that some people are incapable of learning and hearing the truth about the world, but that doesn’t excuse how they have treated people, especially women, who try and educate them. So, out of spite, I called this website Bitchin’. It’s just a place where I can openly speak on topics I enjoy or want to rant about, but to someone out there, I’m just bitching about these issues.
                         I would like to explain more but I am worried if I'll get in trouble with the name.
                         I am open to changing this name if it is offensive and not ideal for educational purposes.</p></p>
