                        Many people, specifically white, Eurocentric people, want the swastika to be banned completely across the entirety of humanity. As in, if this symbol is ever seen, there needs to be punishable and legal action taking place. Looking back at my previous blog posts, this sense of power and entitlement over knowledge on a symbol is important to investigate. From the previous posts, we can understand that whiteness is at itâ€™s most corrosive when it has convinced us that everything originates from it. The fact is that the swastika has been used by many POC cultures for centuries, yet it was stolen by the white man who twisted it into something dark and vile. This is a true example of colonialism affecting us in the present day. Many people do not understand the original, true meaning of the swastika and where it is from. Unfortunately, it is widely known as a nazi symbol. An extreme example, yes, but still an example of whiteness convincing us that everything stems from it.
