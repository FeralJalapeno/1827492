                        Here’s the issue with the statement “not all men”, it serves the same purpose as “All lives matter”. It is to silence and dismiss a group that is clearly suffering within society. In this case, it is women trying to shed light on the misogynistic world we live in. It is women trying to explain how unsafe it is for them to simply exist. Yet, when they talk about these issues, they are met with a response involving “not all men” or “men are raped and harassed too”. That’s not the point. The point is that there is an exponential difference between men who rape women and men who are raped. </p>
                    
                        <p> Let’s put it this way, if I gave you a bag of jellybeans and told you that a handful of them were extremely poisonous and could kill you, would you still happily eat the jellybeans? No, you’d avoid them instead since it’s safer to be weary of all the jellybeans instead of risking your life. If that example isn’t to your liking, what about snakes? Not all of us are aware on exactly what snakes are venomous, but most of us are just weary of all snakes. Why? Because we don’t want to risk it. So yes, it’s not all men, but it’s safer to be cautious of all of them. </p>
