                        This has everything to do with white privilege existing in our current society. Let’s clear up one thing first, being aware of one’s white privilege does not make them racist. Having white privilege does not automatically make you a racist. However, white privilege only exists and continues to benefit white people due to historical and past racial and bias norms. If it weren’t for colonisation, and the enslavement of people of colour, there would be no white privilege. It took the suffering and genocide of mass peoples and cultures for white people to reach their point of privilege today.

                        White privilege exists in many aspects. The scariest thing about it is that it is always an assumed aspect that everyone sees within a white person. Everything from the medical system to body care products and the law enforcement systems works around the assumed basis of white privilege. It’s the very reason most people fear walking near a group of black men compared to a group of white men.  It is why the Black Lives Matter movement is important and even exists.
