                        “All lives matter” may seem like a valid statement to the oblivious and the ignorant, but it is a highly problematic and anti-black statement. Before anyone argues with that statement, just pause to think – where did the statement “all lives matter” come from? The statement is a result of the original “Black Lives Matter” slogan. It is a social movement aimed at addressing and fighting against the violence and oppression against black people. This includes the historical era and the very present, since the historical context is the cause for the modern context.

                        “Black lives matter” is NOT a statement that excludes other races. Instead, it questions our reality where black people are constantly stigmatized and discriminated against. It simply tells us that black lives matter too, just as all lives do. However, “All lives matter” is a deathly term, especially since it stands to silence the point of “Black lives matter”. Yes, we know that every human life matters… that why we expect society to start valuing the lives of black people! By saying that problematic statement, all that occurs is the continuing silence of black voices – black lives. It silences the people that are trying to reach within the system and be seen and valued.

                        Would you show up to a random funerals and tell everyone to stop crying because you too have lost someone before? Exactly.
