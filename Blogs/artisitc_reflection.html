                        This is going to be extremely brief since this is just a basic idea of what I would like to do. My art reflection 2 will probably be a bit more in-depth since more time will pass and I’ll have a better and bigger understanding on what I wish to accomplish with this idea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, my understanding of ‘Internet Art” is that it is art that only exists because of the internet. If the internet were to disappear, then this type of art would cease to exist. It’s not like a picture of the Monalisa that exists online because even if the internet were to disappear, the Monalisa would still exist. Now, this is where I had some sort of break through. What else exists primarily because of the internet and would cease to exist with it? The answer is memes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If we push aside the discussion on intermediality ( if you’d like an extensive discussion and a whole post dedicated to intermediality, I am willing :D) we can see memes as a piece of media on it’s own that exists because of the internet. There are many aspects that contribute to this, such as the size and variety of internet based platforms memes are created, shared and viewed upon. As much as memes rely on other forms of media to exist, such as movies, comics etc, the internet plays a large role in it’s very existence.
                        So what the hell does decolonisation and memes have to do with anything? Let alone internet art. Well, memes on their own can be considered as a form of internet art, but my job is to make them a bit more… political. Aside from being entertaining and giving me a serotonin boost for 2 seconds, I think it would be absolutely fascinating to take social and political view points and marry the two to make a form of internet art.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Enough babbling, let me finally explain what my actual idea is. As a game design student, naturally I thought of making some sort of “game”. The game would essentially just be a web page with a bunch of card, like you see on the blog post page, that will read a specific political or social stance/opinion. Whatever card reads something that resonates with you, or something you agree on, you will click it and then be sent to a different page that shows you what kind of meme “represents” that opinion/ stance.
                        An example would be a card reading “A woman should not be the bread winner in a relationship” and if someone agrees with that card, they’ll click it and be sent to 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW_sy2D4i90" >this meme.</a> And this meme is just a response to that sort of opinion/stance.
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Hopefully this makes sense and I’ll have a much more in-depth discussion by reflection 2. I want the cards have a timeless aspect in the world of memes, as in it incorporates things from tumblr memes to vine and now the recent tiktok trends. I also want the cards to represent something about myself, in relation to memes and be a bit more deeper in context despite having a playful aspect.
