                        This blog post continues and expands on our conversation on decolonisation. I will be focusing on Dr Achille Mbembe’s paper, “Decolonizing Knowledge and the Question of the Archive”. Not only does this paper contain vital points, but it is also a major influence on my final year project. With that being said, be prepared for the deep dive we’re about to take into my mind. I heavily agree with Mbembe’s discussions, especially that our post-colonial society lacks clarity. (Mbembe, 2015 p.1)

                <h1 class="page-title">White people are not natives</h1>
                <p>
                    In a South African context (and many others), white people are merely settlers of this land. Black people are the true natives since they were on this land long before any white man, yet many white South Africans push the title of “native” onto themselves. However, with our current state of democracy and constitutional state, we are all considered citizens (Mbembe, 2015 p.1). Goodbye to labels of the native and the settler. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But is this not a problem? Yes, it is wonderful that we strive towards a society and constitution that views every human as an “equal” citizen but moving past the notion of natives and settlers is forcing is to move back rather than forward. So, what do I mean by this exactly? Well, this whole perspective of all races being deemed as equal citizens may look pretty on paper but is false if we face reality for what it truly is. It’s nothing but our white compatriots attempt to “off-shore” their privileges, when these very privileges are going nowhere (Mbembe,2015 p.2). Regardless of the abolishment of slavery, the privileges it gave white people still stand in our society today. There are countless examples and scenarios I could discuss to explain and expand on this, but we don’t have that kind of time.
                </p>

            <article id="main-col">
                <h1 class="page-title">Demythologizing Whiteness</h1>
        
                    <p>
                        Mbembe uses the example of Cecil Rhodes to expand on this. Naturally, I will do the same. Whether or not people still disagree, Rhodes is part of the “race of men who were convinced that to be black is a liability” (Mbembe, 2015 p.2). The fact is that he stole, exploited and mass murdered countless black people in Southern Africa. He used his financial and political power from the British government to dispossess black people of their ancestral lands. Essentially, the settler stealing from the native. Of course, this act of theft was done through gruesome and aggressive means. After all, the natives did not simply agree to give up their land – their homes.
But then why are so many people still in denial of Rhodes being an evil and racist excuse of a human being? If we look at a different example, one of Lewis and Clarke,  we can understand how perspective has quite the influential role when it comes to storytelling. In Ella Inglebret’s curriculum, she focuses on the storytelling of the Lewis and Clark expedition. She points out how the story of their travels has exclusively been told from their perspectives for over 150 years. This results in the story dismissing the experience and encounters the Native American people had with these explorers. (Inglebret, 2013, p.1). Only in recent years has the Natives’ experiences and history with Lewis and Clark been incorporated in how this story is told. Essentially, the perspective of Lewis and Clark painted them as wondrous explorers who assisted the natives. The actual reality is that they forced their own people to migrate and invade the natives’ land. With them, they brought disease that decimated many native tribes. Yet, for over 150 years, that side of the story was never shared. Although changes are being made now, on how the story is being told, the damage is still done and many of the natives still aren’t understood as people who were wronged and suffered. The way the education works is still in favor of the settlers, Lewis and Clarkes’s perspective, not the natives.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, this situation tells us that the perspectives in which stories are told has influence as well as importance. Depending on what perspective the audience receives the story from ultimately changes how they feel and interpret the story – how they interpret and believe history. Yet, if we truly believe we are entering an era of freedom and equality, why do statues of colonial villains still stand? Why are they still looked up upon in public and political spaces? 
If you are unaware, in 2015 a statue of Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town. It was met with cheering students who protested for months that the statue of a British colonialist should be removed. The point was that such a statue held major symbolic power that essentially idolized a man that exploited black lives and their land.
As Mbembe wonderfully puts it, the argument should have never been about whether the statue should be removed. The argument should have always been WHY it took so long to get rid of that statue. This structure of a colonialist stood as the main hall that held almost every ceremony and graduation was named after Rhodes’s racist and destructive lieutenant, Jameson. Should I even bother mentioning how Rhode’s University is still called RHODES BLUDY UNIVERSITY? Instead, this institution just removed the bust of Rhodes a their main entrance in order to avoid the discussion around changing it’s name… pathetic. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many love to argue on how the Rhodes statue should remain since Rhodes , himself, ever so kindly gave up “his” land and money in order to build these universities. But <i>how</i> did he end up is possession of that land in the first place? Ah yes, he stole it. His statue has absolutely nothing to do with the campus, especially after 20+ years of “freedom” (Mbembe, 2015 p.3). As Mbembe explains, removing such statues is one of the many, many ways in which we can demythologize white history and finally put it to rest. No longer should the white man’s savior complex be continued but ended as the truth is told as the new norm. As mentioned before, to demythologize whiteness, we must demythologize specific versions of history – tell it from a native perspective.

                <h1 class="page-title">White Entrapment</h1>
        
                    <p>
                        If we want democracy and we believe in a democracy, then we cannot allow democracy to be built on versions of whiteness. Mbembe makes an important point that human history goes far beyond whiteness, yet our world makes us believe history from a white perspective. “Whiteness is at it’s best when it turns into a myth” (Mbembe,2015 p.3). Whiteness is the most damaging and lethal when is makes us believe that everything stems from it. As discussed in my previous blog post, the western ideology around “private knowledge” heavily promotes this belief of everything originating from whiteness. Therefore, there needs to be a demythologizing of whiteness. Our democracy will either cease to exist or be built on the versions of whiteness that continued to uphold a figure like Rhodes during an era of “freedom”. These versions of whiteness need to be recalled and de-commissioned to finally put this part of history to rest and finally free ourselves from this white entrapment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But these versions of whiteness go beyond figures of white men, it also includes figures like Gandhi. In recent years, during the Black Lives Matter protests in the USA, a statue of Gandhi was removed at the University of Legon in Ghana. Many may ask why was a statue of an Indian man who played a major role in freeing Indian people from British slavery removed in the first place. Afterall, this very man faced imprisonment in both South Africa and India for defying the racist regime upheld by the British. Well, to simply put it, Gandhi was a racist man. As much as he is still idolized and praised by the Indian population for his efforts, he was anti-black. My family is part of the last shipment of indentured slaves from the south of India.As much as I can understand the grueling efforts he made in opposing the system of import of indentured labour from India, I cannot excuse the role he has played in further pushing black people further down the hole of colonial ideals. There are many sources and claims, especially from the mouth of the late Nelson Mandela, that acknowledge Gandhi’s eventual change. However, his earlier perspectives and writings show a very anti-black man. In 1893, Gandhi wrote to the Natal parliament saying that a "general belief seems to prevail in the Colony that the Indians are a little better, if at all, than savages or the Natives of Africa". In many of his early pieces of literature, Gandhi made it clear that he believed Indians should not be treated or seen at the same level of black people. At the time, all people of colour were treated the same. Do you think that his eventual political and social success had any effect on the social and economic difference that exists between Indian people and black people now? Just a thought to consider.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe this is just my hot take, but I do see how Gandhi led India to independence of working with the British colonial government while promoting racial segregation in which black people continued to suffer. In 1904 he wrote his concerns to a health officer which stated, “"About the mixing of the K****s with the Indians, I must confess I feel most strongly."

            <article id="main-col">
                <h1 class="page-title">Context within Westernization</h1>
        
                    <p>
                        In that last paragraph, I very clearly avoided and censored the use of the K word. At the end of the day, I am a South African and therefore I live in a country where such a word has a disgusting past and symbolic hold against black South Africans. Therefore, I will never speak the word nor spell it out, even to get someone to understand what I am referring to. However, outside of South Africa, the word is still used but in an extremely different context. The word originally is a term used by Muslims towards non-believers. Especially in India where many Muslims used the word against Hindus or other Muslims that strayed away from their faith. Given that you are aware of both contexts, does that mean the word should be banned/outlawed worldwide? Given more research, it is believed that this word has been used by European settlers against black people long before Muslims made a presence in South Africa . “G. Theal indicates that European settlers in South Africa adopted the word from its use by East African Muslims for ‘infidels’ in the southern part of Africa” (Baderoom, p.3). It appears to be a case of Europeans learning how to call someone an infidel in another language and then using it against the people they wish to overpower. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, given that we’ve discussed the word in two different contexts, lets look at another example that appears to be more controversial yet has striking similarities. I am referring to the swastika symbol and how majority of the world, specifically parts with major western influence, immediately associate the symbol with the Nazi’s. The origin of the swastika is but a peaceful and spiritual one. A symbol across Asian cultures that represents peace and hope. Yet, it was stolen and altered by white supremacists ( N.B: they were WHITE) and transformed into a symbol that represented pure destruction and evil. There is still varying opinions and debates around the swastika symbol, many of which are blatantly coming from a white superiority complex. I have noticed how many people argue and claim that this symbol needs to be outlawed and ridden from every culture and corner of the world. Their reasoning is that it is a symbol that is directly linked to the massacre and demolishment of a people and their culture.  No, they’re not referring to the Asian’s it was stolen from, they are referring to Jewish people. It seems quite ironic, to be blind sided to one side of story. As Tim Marshall explains, the action to outlaw the swastika must be strictly contextual. In a western perspective, it is evil but from an Asian perspective it is not. You cannot ban the symbol from a temple but can very much ban it from a political rally. Why? Because the contexts in each situation are completely different. One is spiritual and symbolic of peace and prosperity while the other is fully aware of what the Nazi’s stood for and support it. They are not the same and never will be.
Another ironic thing is how quick people seem to be when reminding others about the holocaust and how the swastika is a Nazi symbol, but don’t seem to do the same when it comes to confederate statues of colonial villains. The swastika has been educated amongst many, including the Asian cultures, that is has a dark past and representation in the West. Due to that, you will not find the true expression of that symbol anywhere other than during a religious ceremony or temple. People who are a part of its original meaning do not wear the symbol on their clothing or lay it out for everybody to see. There is an acknowledgement and understanding that this symbol goes beyond it’s origin, but that doesn’t mean the origin needs to fall away and give in to the western perspective of it. Remember that blog on privatized knowledge? This is part of it. As Mbembe keeps emphasizing, whiteness is the most corrosive when it makes us believe that everything originates from it. To give into the western perspective of the swastika is to lose the original cultural aspect of it. Essentially giving into the whiteness.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Knowing this, it makes sense why it is so hard for people to understand why statues of these colonial leaders need to be removed, specifically from major public places. If the swastika may not be shown on a campus wall due to it’s horrendous past, why are statues of horrendous men who did just as horrendous things still being kept safe and idolized in public spaces? Unfortunately, it all boils back down to white entrapment and how versions of history are told from the white perspective. What is prioritized will not be people of colour. We should be able to empathize with every racial and cultural group that has gone through immense suffering and unfair treatment. As much as we hate the symbol of the Nazi’s, we should just as much hate that they blatantly stole and corrupted an Asian symbol to fit their own selfish, western agenda. We should mourn the loss of people, the loss of various cultures as well as the effects that carry on today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As much as these historical events are sad and gruesome in every aspect, the way we prioritize and view historical events should be questioned. Our education around historical events prevent us from having the awareness, and in turn the empathy, to understand and realize how absolutely messed up the world still is.
