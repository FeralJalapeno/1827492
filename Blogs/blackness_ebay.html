                    <p>
                        This post will discuss Keith Obadike’s 2001 ad on eBay that attempted to auction off his “Blackness”. There’s a lot I can say, in fact there’s countless things to discuss about this sort of art installation. For starters, this is a definite example of internet art. eBay exists, an can only properly exist and function with the internet. Therefore, without the internet, this “Blackness for sale” would never exist. Although this was sone back in the very early 2000’s, it ended up going viral. Ebay removed the auction after just four days, as it was flagged as inappropriate. As much as this artwork can be seen as a joke to an extent, it involves far too many serious aspects to keep us laughing for too long.
                          </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially, it may seem like a joke but Obadike’s aim was to allude his selling of his blackness as something similar to that of a slave auction. It primarily focuses on how the notion of “blackness” is commodified and seen as something that can exist without a black body being present. I know that sounds a bit odd, but I will expand on it soon. As early as this artwork was made, in the year 2001, Obadike was already aware of how the new aspect of the internet was now becoming it’s own culture that consisted of various problematic elements. From what we see in the present day, we know this to be true in many ways.
                        For starters, it’s a common observation to see non-black people adopting everything to do with” blackness” without actually being black. But what the heck does that mean? It means that they want the physical features and get plastic surgery and lip injections to obtain a fuller figure they cannot naturally obtain. It means they use tanning lotion and sit in tanning beds to get a darker skin tone. It means they get cosmetic grills for their teeth and get dreadlocks or cornrows in their hair because it “seems cool”. It means they change their natural speech and put on a “blaccent”.
                         </p>
                    <p>
                        It means they do everything that relates to blackness, without being black. They take aspects of blackness to obtain the aesthetic of blackness without ever facing the social or political effects of blackness. This is a very common thing we see in the world today. Almost every white celebrity, or any non-black celebrity is being exposed and called out for taking aspects of “blackness” and applying it to themselves.  </p>

                <article id="main-col">
                    <h1 class="page-title">Examples expanded</h1>
                    <p>
                        It may be a difficult concept to understand at first, but let’s look at two examples and see how this concept of blackness is being commodified without their even being a black body present. One of the most popular examples lies within Instagram models and popular social media influencers. The most notable is Emma Hallberg. The internet had a massive surge in producing content around Emma and exposing her act of “blackfishing”. Black fishing is when one changes their appearance to appear black/ a person of colour when they are most definitely not. Basically, using blackness as a commodity. So, what did Emma do that proves she is blackfishing. Well, many images surfaced the internet of what she originally looks like and how she looks now online. She now has a much more aggressive (fake) tan and even exclusively texturizes her hair to appear curlier and wears hairstyles typically and traditionally used by black woman. These include bantu knots, kinky curls, box braids and even dreadlocks. She even accentuates her lips with makeup and uses clothing and accessories typically associated with black American women.  </p>
                    <p>
                        The issue is not just about some white woman doing things that are the norm/typical for black women, but rather that when black women existed as themselves, with their natural skin tone and figure and their hairstyles, they were considered untidy, dirty, less than and unprofessional. But, when a white woman commercializes all those aspects and puts them on herself, it is suddenly seen as beautiful. This is where people tend to get the narrative wrong. It’s not about these white people WANTING to be black, it’s about them benefitting from the aspects of blackness while keeping and practising their white privilege. Black people gain nothing and continue to face their own struggles within society, purely based on the fact that they are black. Emma does not want to be black. No one wo exploits blackness wants to truly be a black person, they don’t want to suffer with racial profiling, police brutality and other difficulties. They want the aesthetics. They want everything black except the suffering from being black.  </p>
                    <p>
                        Obadike’s auction offers the right to use certain terms in reference to black people. This includes the n word. This offer does not to have the certificate of authenticity handy whenever using such words. It may seem funny at first, but if we look further, we slowly fall into a cesspool of other problematic issues. Consider the n word, it derives from a racial slur used against black people of America. Given its foul history, today it is a word that is encouraged and enforced to exclusively be used by black people only. Whether you disagree or agree, it cannot be denied that it is extremely powerful for a group of people to take a word that was used against them and make it exclusively their own. It is a massive step in removing a part of the racial power struggles by changing the way the word is used and most importantly, who gets to use it. Unfortunately, many non-black folks still have this strange urge to use the word. When it comes to music or nonchalant talk, they so badly wish to utter the word. Society tends to do a good job sometimes at policing the word, hence why the auction tells buyers to ensure they have the certificate of authenticity whenever they choose to say the word.    </p>
                     <p>
                        The sad thing is that this entire artwork and its point is still so relevant today. The dominant social platforms continue to contribute to the problem of blackness being seen as a commodity, something that can merely be taken and put on, like a lipstick. It alienates blackness as an aesthetic rather than a culture. Of course, this can be applied to almost all ethnic groups. We see it in white yoga teachers essentially white washing and stealing ancient Hindu and Buddhist practises and beliefs to run their yoga classes. A more recent example would be the case of Awkwafina, the Asian- American actress and her recent internet backlash. During an interview, she claimed that she makes sure to never take on an acting role that requires her to do an Asian accent. She explained how it gave into racial stereotypes and negatively affected her people, especially since she does not naturally have an Asian accent. However, the people of the internet had some questions. People asked how she can have that opinion about her own culture and people when she blatantly made use of a “blaccent” and profited off it. It was proven that she never grew up around very many black people and it was therefore not possible for her to naturally assimilate to her surroundings. She also noticeably stopped using the blaccent and failed to take any accountability for what she has said or done. And that is simply how the aspects of blackness are forever exploited and serve those who are non-black. Meanwhile, those who are black and embody blackness as their true being and culture get the short end of the stick.

                        Despite the auction’s warnings, such as” The Seller does not recommend that this Blackness be used while voting in the United States or Florida.”, I just don’t think these warnings matter. They specifically don’t matter if the buyer is white. In the end, they will still be a white person that exists in a world where white privilege exists and is going absolutely no where anytime soon.
