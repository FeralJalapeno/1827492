                    <p>
                        This blog post is one of many to come. It is long but tries it‚Äôs best to encapsulate the complexities of decolonisation. The discussion around decolonisation is not easy, but it can be understood. The main goal is to understand that absolutely nothing is free from decolonising, it is not just about social and political issues, but involves matters of science too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Catherine Hoppers investigates the challenges of integrating indigenous thoughts and practises into our current knowledge systems. Mbembe, Mignolo and Welsh speak on the decolonisation of knowledge in great depth that addresses the colonial mindset that continues to plague our knowledge systems and way of thinking. This blog post will focus on Hopper‚Äôs paper, ‚ÄúIndigenous Knowledge and the Integration of Knowledge Systems: Towards a philosophy of articulation‚Äù (Hoppers, p.388).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To begin, Hoppers mentions how there is a ‚Äúmajor transformation and democratisation processes being implemented under the new dispensation. Several macro-level policies provide frameworks for understanding the equity, empowerment and development thrusts in government policies‚Äîfor example, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), the policy of Growth, Equity and Reconstruction (GEAR), the National System of Innovation, and the African Renaissance.‚Äù (Hoppers, p.388)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These frameworks provide an agenda that involves identity reconstruction and innovation, human rights, sustainable development, and democratisation across Africa. In particular, the African Resistance focuses on recognizing Africa and its many languages, with the inclusion of rewriting the main principles of history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hoppers also mentions that the world stands at a ‚Äúcrossroad‚Äù where it searches for new ‚Äúhuman centred visions of development in health, in preserving and conserving biodiversity, in human rights, and in the alleviation of poverty‚Äù (Hoppers, p.388). From this we understand that Africa is attempting to find its own renaissance and terms of development. We must understand that the effects of globalisation have brought affluence to a very small minority of people. With this, human existence is centred around the suffering and dispossession of others. The effects of colonisation caused a major cultural loss within African societies that have led to their collapse. I‚Äôll say it again, globalisation only assists a small part of the people on this earth. It is something that ‚Äún is threatening the appropriation of the collective knowledge of non-Western societies into proprietary knowledge for the profit of a few.‚Äù (Hoppers, p.389)
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, despite that being said, there seem to be a number of agencies within colonial benefitting countries (The United States) that have conventions that focus on addressing issues within diversity and indigenous people‚Äôs rights and their knowledge. It may seem that there is a drive towards a change that benefits and includes indigenous people into the knowledge system. However, the agencies involved in these conventions do not seem to practise the point these conferences seem to hold. Let‚Äôs look at the example Hopper provides;

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ‚ÄúAlso involved, playing an active though ethically unclear role, are the Trans-National Corporations (TNCs) with immense financial power, but with short-term profit motives keen to exploit genetic and other resources from the so-called Third World countries. The TNCs are protected by the agreements initiated at the Uruguay Round, which led to the formation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The WTO is the global trade ‚Äúpolice‚Äù interested in eliminating all trade barriers worldwide. However, it is also the WTO that legislates the idea of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in a manner that assumes individual ownership (a Western phenomenon) as a universal phenomenon and excludes the notion of ‚Äúcollectivity‚Äù that characterises ownership of IPRs in many societies in the Third World.‚Äù (Hoppers, p.389)

                <h1 class="page-title">Dangers of Private Ownership</h1>
                <p>
                    The important thing to note is that individual ownership is a Western phenomenon, therefore it is not an indigenous or cultural phenomenon. The issue is that this Western phenomenon is assumed as a universal practise which is problematic in numerous ways. The WTO wants to establish new regimes of intellectual property rights when Third World countries are in now position to actively participate in this (Hoppers, p.389). Because of colonisation, Third World countries cannot afford or still need to invest in the systems that will provide the education and create skills to manage IPRS. Therefore, its people already run at a loss. It is vital to note that many existing IPR systems ‚Äúencourage the appropriation of traditional knowledge for commercial use; moreover, without the fair sharing of benefits with the holders of knowledge.‚Äù (Hoppers, p.389) These systems revolve around this idea of ‚Äúprivate ownership‚Äù which excludes the indigenous ideologies around collective creation and ownership of knowledge. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To assist in understanding how dangerous the phenomenon of private ownership is, let us discuss an example:For context, let me tell you about a traditional Vietnamese dish called Pho (say it like fuh). This dish is commonly sold as well as enjoyed by Vietnamese people. Now that there is an understanding of what Pho is, let‚Äôs get to the example‚Ä¶
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2013 a white-owned restaurant in the U.K trademarked the word ‚ÄúPho‚Äù and then proceeded to sue a small Vietnamese restaurant for using the word ‚ÄúPho‚Äù in their name. Yes, the <b>white</b> people, Stephen, and Juliette, tried to sue a <b>Vietnamese</b> owned restaurant for using a <b>traditional/native</b> word that has been in their culture for centuries. The owner, Stephen, has also claimed that absolutely no one who works at his restaurant are Vietnamese. If you think that‚Äôs not bizarre enough, how about the fact that these white owners of a Vietnamese restaurant make absolutely no traditional Vietnamese food. Instead, they have heavily altered the traditional dishes for it to seem more ‚Äúpalatable‚Äù for Western consumption. Therefore, this ‚ÄúVietnamese‚Äù restaurant is simply white-washing traditional Vietnamese food to suit the western aesthetic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a prime example of how dangerous and ignorant private ownership can be. This push in our society to claim things as our own is selfish as it often comes from taking advantage of indigenous and traditional people who stray away from the western ideal. Looking at this example, we see that this notion of Pho is shared and therefore considered a collective knowledge amongst Vietnamese people. Vietnam and its people do not hold legal actions towards non-Vietnamese people who cook or consume Pho. Nor do they sue any restaurant that uses the words Pho in its menus. It‚Äôs like trying to trade mark ‚Äúchicken noodle soup‚Äù ‚Ä¶ it seems stupid until we involve words that are not English. Words we typically won‚Äôt understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thankfully, these white owners lost their case and received extreme backlash. Majority of these types of cases do not always have a happy ending. In many aspects of our lives, such as medications and clothing, there is a case of private ownership that has stolen from an indigenous/traditional practise. Therefore, present IPRS appropriate traditional knowledge without benefitting the original shareholders of that very knowledge. This violation of indigenous culture pushes this serious need for innovation in the intellectual property regime itself (Mashelkar 2000).

                <h1 class="page-title">Science and decolonisation</h1>
                <p>Moving onto the notions of <b>science</b> , the UNESCO Declaration on Science and the Science Agenda Frame-work, urges its member countries to work on ensuring that science responds better to society‚Äôs true needs. ‚ÄúIt reiterated the need for political commitment to the scientific endeavour and, especially, to make science more responsive and more inclusive. Science should become more accountable, more communicative, and more dialogical. "(Hoppers, p.390). I see this as a vital declaration since it promotes a mindset that involves the aspect of science within the realm of decolonisation. From personal experience, decolonisation is deemed as a humanities topic. Science based students are not educated on decolonisation in the way humanities students are. There is not focus on the horrors of the colonial past and why it is important to see how it still affects society today. But the truth is that nothing in our society is immune to the subject of decolonisation. It is not just a matter of humanities, but a considerably large matter of science as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The UNESCO Declaration wants the vision of science to decipher words such as ‚Äúethics ‚Äúand ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù through scientific knowledge. The aim is to have a science that understands and values that science is a product of cultures and to be seen as a shared asset. The diverse manifestations must be recognised (Hoppers, p.390). The number system we practise today is not the white-mans creation, it is the Hindu-Arabic system. Therefore, we can understand that the basis of numbers is collectively shared knowledge. It is not a privately owned system, it was created by Indian mathematicians and adopted by Arabic mathematicians. However, things changed once Europeans started adopting this system. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of greatest and earliest mathematicians weren‚Äôt all white, European men. Because of colonisation and globalisation, many people seem to believe that mathematics and its complexity is a pure white-mans creation. In school, we seem to only be taught about Einstein and his great mathematical fiats. We never seem to be taught about the ancient Indian mathematicians from the 1st century, but rather look at the European history ‚Äì the white history. I remember being forced to learn how to write in Roman numerals, but never being taught on the true origins of modern mathematics.  There are many issues with this but let‚Äôs look deeply into it for just a moment. Since our number system was created by Indian mathematicians, and they are descended from Brahmi numerals, there must be so much more deeper meaning beyond what we practise with these numbers today. From my own understanding as a practising Hindu, I am aware of the deep philosophical and spiritual practises that have existed within India for centuries. What would stop these practises from existing within their own created number system?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we look at Kareem Carr, we see a former mathematician who received severe backlash from the ‚Äúmathematic‚Äù community. Carr brings up this statement of ‚Äú2+2=5‚Äù as a means of questioning the understanding of mathematics we know today. He explains that maths is not a black and white phenomenon, it is an abstraction of our reality. His stance challenges the way in which are post-colonial world views mathematics. By using numbers purely to turn everything into data, we encourage these statistical models to continue creating more harm than good. An example he mentions are IQ tests, where the properties of the score might not truly mirror the things being measured. But why do many people disagree with his discussions around mathematics? Well, I believe that it‚Äôs because these very people have never been educated or introduced to mathematics in a manner that goes beyond statistics. Our education system does not teach maths as an abstraction that exists within our reality - it does not associate ethics or deep philosophical thought with mathematics. To me, this is a problem. It encourages the Western ideology of what mathematics is. The origins of what we know as mathematics today can be found in ancient Indian religious texts. Many religious structures made use of mathematical equations to aid in the construction.
                </p>
                
                    <h1 class="page-title">Architecture and decolonisation</h1>
                    <p>
                        Speaking of construction, Dr Lwazi Lushaba speaks on <a href="url">decolonizing education in simple terms</a> here.
                    He mentions something important involving architecture. The society we live in today idolizes, teaches, and practises the Western ideal for architecture. Many native and indigenous people have lost their knowledge and cultural, architectural knowledge to adapt living in this Western ideal world. We are brainwashed into believing that modern architecture is the peak of human intelligence and capabilities. This is not true. It is simply a mere notion that praises the white ideal and pushes the sense of the white man being societies saviour. If we research and look at ancient architecture, we will understand how modern architecture is not as superior as we are led to believe. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An example would be the Kailasa Temple located in the Ellora caves, Maharashtra, India. This is one of the largest rock-cut temples found in India. It was carved from a rock cliff face between 756-773 CE. The interesting thing is that this was built in an era where electric tools and many modern construction equipment did not exist. Yet, this massive temple was carved out entirely from a cliff. It‚Äôs detail and structure massively outweighs something like Mount Rushmore. Rushmore took 14 years to complete WITH explosives and power tools, yet it cannot compete with the complexity of the Kailasa Temple. Another thing to think about is how many ancient structures, such as the Egyptian pyramids, have many within the western world creating theories of how these communities of ancient people must have had extra-terrestrial assistance to create such astronomical structures without any modern tools. Now, I‚Äôm not saying we can‚Äôt believe in extra-terrestrial life, I‚Äôm just saying we should question why it‚Äôs so hard to believe that ancient, non-white civilisations were capable of such amazing things. It just shows how much of the western ideal has taken over.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dr Lushaba mentions how South Africa continuously induces a divide between its people by separating the poor from the rich in extreme architectural differences. This continues the loop of poverty amongst the poor as their architectural differences prevent them from having access to the best education systems, plumbing and shopping districts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What does this all say about our current stance on science? Like the UNESCO declaration mentions, science must transform itself to become more sustainable and inclusive of all people. It must welcome other forms of knowledge in terms of its culture of admission and operation (Hoppers, p.390). The most important thing is that science takes a stance on issues that affect global development, whether it be pollution or poverty- it needs to value the well-being of all people.
                    </p>
