                        Defining Internet art can be confusing. I was confused when I first heard of it, unsure of what could possibly be considered as “Internet Art”. Was it any art that could be viewed online? Or was it art that was made online? Well, I have concluded that internet art is art that exists because of the internet. It is art that relies heavily on the internet to be viewed, understood, or interacted with.

                    <p>
                        However, the internet has changed a lot about art, even traditional, and how it can be viewed/interacted with. Carrier discusses how “The natural home of art criticism is now the internet, as commentaries are posted and read alongside the shows they are critiquing.” (Carrier, 2021, p. 4) . Despite some people still preferring the nostalgic experience of visiting a gallery and holding a print piece, the way the internet has influenced art is quite vast.

                        Carrier explains that, “We are all André Malraux now. To create his “museum without walls,” an archive of images from around the world, begun in 1947, he had to collect and sift through thousands of photographs. Now anyone can readily compare any selection of works, setting them side-by-side.” To see the great classics, we can simply search them up on the internet and line them up ourselves to look at. Although some may argue that this is not an authentic experience of seeing them in a museum, it is something that leads to conversations about accessibility.

                        Carrier does speak on how the internet reproduces images of these original artworks. In terms of transmediality and transformation, the original artwork is merely a source- a reference, rather than a unique artifact. I won’t get into that topic in this blog, but it is interesting to keep in mind how the mentality around artworks changes as the way we access them has changed.

                    <h1 class="page-title">Indirect Flights</h1>
                    <p>
                        However, that all speaks about art on the internet and not internet art. Merely taking a picture of a painting and putting it online makes that art <b>on</b> the internet. Internet art would be something like “Indirect Flights” by Joe Hamilton. It is a collection of layered images hosted online. There are various images layered on top of each other, such as brush strokes, textures, and Hamilton’s personal travel photos. The images are incorporated in such a way that creates an interactive panorama that can be moved in all directions.

                    <p>
                        By placing the images in an aerial view, it mimics the experience of flying over a landscape while in an airplane, without actually being in an airplane- probably why the name of the piece is “Indirect Flights”. The inclusion of landscape images and objects in contrast to the brush strokes seem to contrast the traditional art notion reality and the abstract art created.

                    <p>
                        So, how is this considered Internet art. Well, without the internet, this piece as it is would not exist. By hosting this piece on the internet, it allows for code to be involved is seamlessly blending the images together and allowing the user to scroll through and move around. Hamilton’s goal was to allow the user to pan through his images like you can on the terrain of Google Maps. This indeed emphasizes how this piece is considered internet art. Google Maps can not exist without the internet, therefore it’s feature of panning across the world’s terrain cannot exist without the internet. Indirect Flights is directly influenced by aspects of the internet, since it only exists due to the existence of the internet.
