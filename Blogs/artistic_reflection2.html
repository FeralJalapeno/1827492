                    <p>
                        Now comes the moment where I explain my internet art idea more. A few things have changed from the first reflection, but I‚Äôll slowly get into that. This reflection includes a lot of my technical concerns since I now made a prototype and can see where my issues lie.
Firstly, each card has a common theme- it has a SpongeBob meme. This is done for two important reasons, number one being that I love SpongeBob. It‚Äôs something that relates to me personally and I like that I could add that to this. The other reason is more important, but my personal touch matters more to me! Anyway, the second reason is that SpongeBob is unique as a medium. There was, and still is a steady pace of SpongeBob memes being relevant and relatable on the internet. The unique thing is that you could pause any episode at any time and the frame you stop on can be made into a meme. If you disagree, I challenge you to watch any episode and pause it randomly. Then I dare you tell me you don‚Äôt ever see that frame as a meme/ a potential meme. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each card therefore has a still frame or gif of a SpongeBob episode. The image itself will not be explicit to the text it accompanies, after all, SpongeBob memes are read in a context that is extremely different to the original context of the episode it was taken from. So basically, it‚Äôs all up to interpretation at that point. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of the card themselves and the webpage, they will keep the same design and consistency you see throughout the website. This involves things such as colour, positioning etc. I think this is an important decision since weaves this artwork to appear as another aspect within the entire website, rather than being seen as a separate entity that is accessed through the website. The links and consistency in design will give it that sense of flow, a sense of belonging and relevance. That‚Äôs just my opinion. I tried making the cards very different with different shapes, effects, and colours but it seemed too alienating. It didn‚Äôt feel like the artwork was linked to the entire website, despite contextually being linked. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole website has the aesthetic and sarcastic take on me just bitchin‚Äô about topics that are vital for us to understand and grow our understanding on. I struggle tremendously with speaking to my generation on these topics (unless they‚Äôre smart :D) and often get told I‚Äôm too obsessed with reading ‚Äútoo deeply‚Äù into things. Of course, I know that‚Äôs not true, but it does get frustrating. Despite this, I have also realized how memes tend to be a common sense of communication in my generation. By this I mean that most people can‚Äôt understand decolonisation, but they understand any ‚Äúcave man SpongeBob‚Äù meme, even if they‚Äôve never watched an episode of SpongeBob in their entire life. So if that‚Äôs possible, surely education on certain topics can have some sort of affect. I‚Äôm not saying this will educate them thoroughly, but it‚Äôs more of like a thought provoking experience. Like you picked a card, but why does the meme feel insulting in a way? Looking at semiotics and all that lovely theory on intermediality, memes transform to create new vessels of communication and varying contexts. So, my logic is that if I can‚Äôt get someone to see how idiotic their political/social opinion is, will a meme be able to? Again, it‚Äôs highly affected by interpretation, but the very core of memes somehow manages to relay a sense of understanding across the majority. </p>
                    <p>
                        But, I guess the only thing left to do is test it out and see if it makes any sense. It makes sense to me, but I am but a mere student trying to play around with things are don‚Äôt completely understand ‚Ä¶ yet üòâ. There will be quite a few cards set up and I am not sure if there is a way to make implementing them easier/quicker. Right now, the changing of images for every new card is a bit tedious, but alas, I don‚Äôt know how to change that without breaking everything so I‚Äôm going to continue with the tedious tasks. Another aspect is the changing of webpages when you click a card. I think it‚Äôs better to reload to a whole new website with the meme immediately after clicking the card, rather than showing a pop up. I just feel like that immediate change forces the user into focusing/reading into the meme they just watched, as opposed to simply closing the tab and picking a different card quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hopefully the prototype gives a better understanding as to what I am trying to achieve. I realize that using React would help a lot in the implementation of the cards and avoid the tediousness, but as my technical reflection mentions, I am incompotent.
