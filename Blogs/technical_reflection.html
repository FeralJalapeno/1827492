                        So, this is just a page dedicated to me roasting myself and maybe complimenting myself here and there. For starters, I’d like to mention how my laptop being out of commission for a week and stage 4 load-shedding has been absolutely kicking me in the shins when it comes to doing work. Everything I do require both the internet and a some-what stable PC … having neither or one missing can be quite the show.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides that being said, regardless of the technical difficulties, I would’ve always reached this point anyway. I do think that would more time I could have worked more on the internet art prototype, however I think receiving feedback on whether the idea makes sense and seems viable is more important right now.

                <article id="main-col">

                    <p>
                        In terms of my self-assessment, I’d like to start off with the theory first. In terms of the close reading and the art analysis, I reckon I’d give myself full marks for those two. I say this because I know I thoroughly enjoyed writing those pieces since I was able to expand on the theoretical aspects of the blog posts, while incorporating my own perspective along with external examples. It felt comforting to know I could spill over into discussions I’ve spent years researching and contemplating. When it comes to topics around decolonisation, I care a lot and find that I have too much to say. I’d probably minus like 10%, purely on the posts being quite long and expansive.  If they are too long, please let me know. I have divided every reading into separate parts so that I can focus on discussing fewer aspects in more depth instead of squashing in the entire paper.

                    <p>
                        In terms of this technical reflection, I’d give myself 80%. I know at this point you haven’t read through everything yet, but I know I am very honest with myself and expand on things more. I noticed Hanli’s feedback mention that these need to be longer and in separate blog posts, and I do feel as if I have made those changes. They can always be better though, specifically the artistic reflection one. I have struggled with that one the most. I don’t know why, but I’m not always sure on what I need to mention or speak on. Sometimes I feel a bit awkward explaining my logic around memes and my design choices. I guess I feel like it seems odd at times and maybe I’m the only one that thinks it makes sense. Therefore, I’d give myself 60%.  Although I have explained most of my design choices and why I think they work out, I also think there is potential to speak more about them. However, for the actual creative aspect- the artwork, I’d give myself at least 70% for that section. I think my choices and decision it involve memes directly links to my website as a whole, as well as incorporate a massive artistic phenomenon of the internet : memes. I think it’s quite unique to bring something so light hearted and merge it with a liberal intention.

                    <p>
                        Oh gosh, so the coding… the bane of my existence. However, I do believe that I have significantly improved since last year. In terms of good UI practises, colour palette choice and responsiveness, I have improved. The issue I seem to have is with JS. I am aware that my website makes no use of JS, but at the time when I started te HTML and CSS I wasn’t sure what to even use JS for. For this assignment I tried two things, I tried changing the highlights and animations to work in JS rather than CSS, but that didn’t work. It was way too time and consuming to change what I already had, especially since the feedback commended what I had already done. Andre did suggest that I use JS as an opportunity to render my navigation, so I don’t have to keep reimplementing it on every single page. However, I tried that, and completely broke everything (not intentionally). I tried putting the navigation into one separate HTML file and then implementing that onto every web page using JS… it did not work at all, and I lack the skills to know why it didn’t. I even tried Googling methods to try and absolutely nothing viable/commonly practised seems to come up. Maybe I’m just completely incompetent but I would need a step by step sit down on how to fix that aspect of my website.  </p>
                    <p>
                        So, this assignment is missing two things, JS and React.JS. not surprising given that I can’t successfully implement any JS into my site anyway. React is a whole different story. While I didn’t have a working PC for a week, I did not realize how time consuming React.JS was going to be for me. I did not expect myself to struggle so much so I simply gave up. I’m going to be honest, I am just not good and getting code to work. I’m more of a discussions kinda gal… clearly since I speak so much on the blog posts. However, I do notice that out of the technical aspect, I am just missing the use of React for my internet art and JS throughout my website. Because I believe I’m on a roll with everything else, I’d give myself 70% for the technical total.</p>
