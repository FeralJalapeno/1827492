                    <p>
                        Overall, nothing much has changed within the technical aspect of the website. In terms of ReactJS, I expand and talk about that more in my self-reflection. I don’t want to repeat too much of what is said there so I’ll stick to the basics here.
When it came to the implementation of the website, I feel that using React would have helped a lot in terms of reimplementing the cards and the navigation. As much as the previous feedback says the use of sematic markup is good and that the website is responsive, in terms of making it easier for me, using ReactJS would have been better.
However, in my reflection, you will see my problem with using React and my thoughts on implementing it in this project.

                    <h1>Artistic comments</h1>
                    <p>
                        After carefully considering the previous feedback, I have made a few changes. The first is that the website uses “consistent” characters as an aesthetic. This was in reference to using Spongebob memes for my internet artwork. To keep things consistent, I changed the gifs of the homepage to similar memes.
One lecturer mentioned that they did not like the background that was initially in my website, so I just removed that. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of the artwork in relation to the website, I think I’ve managed to link everything up to one another. Now, the internet art no longer has cards that lead to random links of memes, instead it opens a new webpage that embeds the meme, has a small discussion underneath it and then includes additional source material on the side. This internet art piece intersects and involves the entirety of the website. Firstly, the cards remain a constant theme throughout the website. Secondly, each card covers a liberal topic. This time, the statements are less jarring and blatantly obscure. Now, they hold statements that most “liberal” people can fall trap to. It emphasizes and sticks to the main theme within the website- educating. 
Essentially, each statement is represented on a card. With each statement, there is a corresponding meme that serves as a response to that statement. If someone clicks on the card and does not understand the meme and its response, there is additional text and sources provided in order to educate them and help them understand. I think it is as interesting way in which memes can be combined with liberal discussions and academia in order to educate others. I see this as a tool that can be refined and used to help others learn about these sorts of topics. An example would be someone trying to get their sibling to understand why “All lives matter” is a problematic statement. Their sibling could click on the card, see the meme response and then read up on why it’s an issue. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do prefer the previous prototype where the cards would just send the user off to a meme and that was it, no additional discussions or sources. I liked that sense of exit from the site and immediate face to face with a meme as a response. However, I understand that it’s not very beneficial in terms of helping someone understand the context/purpose of the meme regarding the statement. I find that this fails in terms of what I initially envisioned. I wanted to create a card like game that you could just click on and see what memes show up in response to the card chosen. Now, it still involves the meme but tries to make it a bit more educational. I tried minimizing how much text I put in, but it still isn’t giving the type of experience I thought it would.
